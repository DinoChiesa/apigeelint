  <Description>Textbook Exchange is part of College Cafe and allows students to exchange their used textbooks with one another.  Students can start an Exchange when they have a used textbook to sell. "For Sale" Textbooks can be searched as well as returned based on a particular class or a student's textbook needs.  &lt;p&gt; When a "For Sale" textbook is found for purchase, the textbook is reserved by assigning another student as the Buyer. The Seller and Buyer then exchange the Textbook via a physical dropbox located at the bookstore using provided entry codes.
